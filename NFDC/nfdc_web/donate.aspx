    I program for the pure enjoyment and fun of figuring out how to create such applications.
    <br />
    Developing each program in my spare time, I also personally use each and every program.
    <br /><br />
    I strive to have every one of my applications absolutely <b><i>FREE</i></b> as I am a believer in having a fully functioning program, and if you like it, supporting the creator.

    I hope you enjoy the use of the applications!
